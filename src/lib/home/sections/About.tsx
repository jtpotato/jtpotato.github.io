        <p>I&apos;m a high school student (VCE ðŸ˜°), developer and a content creator based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
        <p>My programming journey started in 2015 with a 3 day gamedev program. Nearly 10 years later, I&apos;m still coding somehow, working on more advanced and impactful projects than ever before.</p>
        <p>Creating personal projects has allowed me to build familiarity with many technologies in various areas of software engineering, such as the web, mobile, mixed reality and artificial intelligence ðŸ¤“</p>
