                    <p>I'm a high school student (VCE ðŸ˜°), developer and a content creator based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
                    <p>My programming journey started in 2015, with a 3 day gamedev program for kids. Nearly 10 years later, I'm still coding somehow, working on more advanced and impactful projects than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Creating personal projects has allowed me to build familiarity with many technologies in various areas of software engineering, such as the web, mobile, mixed reality and artificial intelligence ðŸ¤“</p>
