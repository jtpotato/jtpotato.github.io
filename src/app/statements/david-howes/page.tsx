          Dear colleagues
          <br />
          <br />
          This has been a term characterised, as always, by continued hard,
          high-quality work across our schools. There have also been some very
          significant challenges and important developments.
          <br />
          <br />I want to first highlight a success that has not been widely
          reported. Students at one of our government schools, the John Monash
          Science School (JMSS), won the 2024 Singapore International
          Mathematical and Computational Challenge.
          <br />
          <br />
          At a time when we are, rightly, considering how we can best strengthen
          numeracy outcomes to achieve some of the improvements we have seen in
          literacy outcomes, this is a reminder that our teachers are helping
          students scale remarkable heights.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Singapore International Mathematical and Computational Challenge
          is one of the most prestigious global school mathematics competitions,
          and to have a Victorian government school win this event is brilliant.
          JMSS&apos;s win is a timely reminder of the excellence as well as the
          equity pursued and achieved by our schools.
          <br />
          <br />
          Congratulations to the staff and students of JMSS, and also to the
          teachers at the primary schools our winners attended that clearly gave
          them such a strong base in mathematics.
          <br />
          <br />
