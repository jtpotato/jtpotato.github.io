Ah... ads...

and other... interesting web things.

Ew... you want my email??? I just wanted to read the damn article :(((

Surely someone working at these media companies noticed the outrage/disappointment that would ensue after showing people a clickbait headline, before revealling that they can't reveal their sHoCkInG sEcReT until after they give the website their email, phone number, location (thanks Location API), what they like to do on the weekend, and heck - while we're at it, their mother's maiden name.

The amount of psychology and engineering that went into creating the current web experience is both extremely impressive and deserving of becoming a new circle of hell. The fact that progress was made so "slowly" (to be fair, 20-odd years isn't slow) meant that internet users almost became accustomed to regular bombardment by advertising.

But recently, some might have taken it just a *little bit* too far.

Incredible. I can't even see what I'm even trying to read here. I understand that signup lists and ads are now engineered for maximum presence, attention and therefore conversion, but I sincerely hope that someone working for the Washington Post had a look at this and maybe thought to themselves "if they can't see the content why would they want to do any of this"

I just want to be able to read. That's what we built the internet for, after all.

I'm not a massive privacy buff - I don't think having corporations know every single little detail about me is the complete end of the world, and I don't spend my days fretting about this Orweillian dystopia. I don't harden my Firefox and I haven't scrapped any of the Microsoft/Apple spyware and jumped ship to Kali Linux or something.

I also create content on YouTube - where ads make up an extremely significant portion of creator revenue, and where people somehow hold the belief that "adblockers are the equivalent of theft" ([it's significantly more nuanced](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1539349-countering-the-ad-blockers-being-theft-argument/)), where the entire platform's history has been written by YouTube's interactions with advertising and advertising policy and how it has been recieved by users.

Previously I would have allowed YouTube to show ads - there was a time where it was less ridiculous and I could appreciate the value I was getting out of it and the ads seemed like a small cost.

Then they started testing longer chains of unskippable ads.

Then they took ad control away from creators, and put more of them into videos.

Then they put more onto the front page.

![Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube](../../public/images/fix-the-web/image-4.png)

Then they started banning adblockers (ones that used cosmetic filtering - from what I can tell, but this is mostly unsubstantiated)

The future of the internet cannot just be doomed to be a wasteland of advertising and ever increasing restrictions on how we can view actual content just to increase the amount of eyeballs on ads. (Something so big deserves a better death anyways)

Are there actual, systemtic solutions to this problem? Probably, but none that are realistically feasible while goals are still set on short term profits for the next quarterly finance report for the shareholders.

It's funny because with the internet I would think that the shareholders would also be prolific users of these products and even they probably don't want to pay for half a million different subscription services (purely because of the paperwork overhead rather than the cost, but I digress) and should really be pressuring companies to do something.

But in the meantime we, lowly users of the internet have bandaids. Really good ones.

Introducing uBlock Origin... Honestly if you're here you probably have already heard about this and don't need to hear it - but in case you're new to the world of actually caring about what you see on the internet, it's a customisable adblocker with most of the work done for you.

And if you have another adblocker of choice, that's fine too - just make sure it can support lists like these:

![My lists](../../public/images/fix-the-web/image-6.png)

Here are the lists that I have personally decided are worth enabling for me. I would **strongly** recommend going beyond the defaults, as some of these lists offer major quality-of-life improvements to your browsing experience.

and would you look at that. The web is usable again. And from now on, never - ever go without an adblocker.
