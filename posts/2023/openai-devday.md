OpenAI made a series of announcements.

### Key Takeaways
- **ChatGPT-4 Turbo**: A new and improved version of their flagship language model, with larger memory, lower cost, new knowledge, and enhanced function calling capabilities.
- **GPTs**: A new way to create customized chatbots for specific purposes, simply by talking to ChatGPT-4. For example, Canva built a GPT that can design posters based on user requests.
- **GPT Store**: A new platform where users can browse, download, and share different GPTs for various use cases, such as education, entertainment, productivity, and more.
- **Copyright Shield**: Aims to protect OpenAI customers when legally threatened.

Quite a few posts have said that this event effecitvely destroyed a bunch of startups depending on OpenAI's API... and that's probably true. With the new GPTs and integration into other services people no longer need specific chatbots to talk to for writing/learning... (although, I never believed that people actually needed to anyway)

The choice to go all-in on the OpenAI ecosystem and develop app stores + a very simple way to build apps took a lot of people by surprise (including myself). While not predictable, in hindsight I do not see any other way that OpenAI could monetise an absolute banger of a product this well without hampering the experience.
