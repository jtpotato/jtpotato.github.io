To procrastinate, I recently embarked on a project to create an AI writing tool that could generate Twitter threads more efficiently. However, what started as a simple experiment quickly turned into a dumpster fire of code plastered together.

***Note from 4-11-2023:*** *This piece was written with text-generation AI. It obviously doesn&#x27;t write in my voice. It&#x27;s also kinda bad, but apparently I&#x27;m supposed to keep it here for archival purposes or something*

![This is fine‚Ä¶](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7gQIHDGCpEocaUTpQBLpdw.jpeg)*This is fine‚Ä¶*

The first obstacle I encountered when creating an AI writing tool was a lack of funds.

As I researched various APIs and tools that could help me develop my project, I quickly realized that I would need to pay for certain services. Large Language Models don‚Äôt come cheap after all‚Ä¶

I was *very *interested in using ChatGPT‚Äôs API, but my wallet, as expected of the average teenager, had been completely spent on bubble tea and progressively more expensive stationery.

At that moment, I knew that my project would be much more difficult than I had initially anticipated.

Fortunately, I was able to discover HuggingFace‚Äôs free Inference API, which provided me with the tools I needed to start testing and building my AI writing tool.

I was relieved to find that the API‚Äôs limits were generous enough to allow me to fully explore the potential of my project. Additionally, I was delighted to learn that OpenAI had released its GPT-2 model for public use, which opened up a whole new range of possibilities for my project.

This reminds me of the power of FOSS. By sharing knowledge and resources, we can empower each other to achieve great things and create innovative solutions to real-world problems‚Ä¶ at the cost of the service providers, but I digress.

While OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-2 model was a game-changer when it first came out, my experience developing an AI writing tool highlighted some of its limitations.

In comparison to ChatGPT, which I had initially wanted to use but couldn‚Äôt afford, GPT-2 fell short in certain areas. Specifically, ChatGPT had a larger training dataset and was able to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

GPT-2 generated the following response: ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs iPhone 14 Pro is the only device supported to be compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Gear 360, a successor to the Gear line up, that can be fitted with a 1.3-inch OLED display on the rear and sides. While some owners may‚Ä¶‚Äù

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2120/1*Hqh4zEOyL2_d5368_HW1sA.png)

This response is clearly nonsensical and barely relatedto the prompt I had entered. However, it highlights one of the challenges of working with AI writing tools ‚Äî the need to carefully curate and filter responses to ensure that they are appropriate and coherent. While GPT-3 and ChatGPT wow us with more coherent, balanced and logical answers, it only means that this issue has been hidden ‚Äî not completely eliminated.

Thanks to HuggingFace‚Äôs Inference API, I was able to switch between different models with ease, including EleutherAI‚Äôs large language models (GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX, etc). These models are more comparable to GPT-3‚Ä¶ allegedly.

Being able to quickly switch between models allowed me to test and experiment with different approaches to writing, helping me to find the optimal solution for my project.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4492/1*Uxf75Vh1G9P3iym6riSD5g.png)

However, when I inputted a prompt into my tool, instead of generating a useful response, it simply extended my question.

![what the heck?? üò≠](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2096/1*Zb-Vg2MVtfI4_DrHIc7voQ.png)*what the heck?? üò≠*

Despite the challenges I encountered along the way, I was determined to create a functional and effective AI writing tool. After many hours of experimentation and a significant amount of API usage, I finally found a solution that worked a little bit better.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4168/1*VotWJF66SSOWJtaVgXgEIA.png)

Through trial and error, I was able to identify the best models and parameters to use for my specific use case. I also refined the input prompts and formatting to ensure the tool generated the most accurate and useful responses.

The final result was a tool that could generate barely coherent and relevant responses to my prompts, allowing me to streamline my writing process and maybe increase my productivity. While it was nowhere close to usable, it was certainly a significant improvement over my initial attempts.

I stumbled upon an interesting approach to generating responses from large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2 and ChatGPT.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2112/1*OQ_g1fhrJBNSUXU5yYxAIA.png)

By ‚Äúfooling‚Äù the LLM into thinking it was simply extending a piece of text rather than generating a response to a prompt, I was able to elicit coherent and relevant responses from the model.

With the AI writing tool itself functional, I turned my attention to building a user interface that would make it accessible and user-friendly for others to use.

However, as I quickly discovered, building a UI with React was no easy feat.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*VJTmZXzFEgbXY4lAa_Hvuw.jpeg)

From struggling to understand the nuances of React syntax and debugging errors, to grappling with the complexities of state management and user input handling, building a UI for my AI writing tool was way more complicated than it needed to be.

Despite the challenges of building a UI with React, I was able to find a solution that worked for me, thanks in part to the simplicity of hosting the app with Next.js and Vercel.

While I may not have become an expert in React or UI design as a result of this project, that was never a requirement anyway.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dGQy0A19Zr8M2YaogEeTrQ.png)

If I did want to showcase my design abilities, I‚Äôd make something like this: [https://first-website-remake-jtpotato.vercel.app](https://first-website-remake-jtpotato.vercel.app/) (oh wait! i did!)

For anyone who wants to check out my AI writing tool for themselves, you can find the source code on my GitHub page and try out the demo on the website.

Despite the challenges I faced along the way, I‚Äôm proud of what I was able to create with my AI writing tool. By experimenting with different language models and using creative strategies to ‚Äútrick‚Äù them into answering prompts, I was able to create a tool that can generate (questionable) writing very quickly.
